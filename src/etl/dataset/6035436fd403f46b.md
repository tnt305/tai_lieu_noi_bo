use of universal telecommunications services:

a) The duration of
support for beneficiaries using universal telecommunications services is
counted from the time the enterprise begins providing the service for the
beneficiary until the beneficiary ceases using the universal telecommunications
services in accordance with regulations. Where a public-utility
telecommunications service program ends and a subsequent-period program has
been issued but the competent state authority has not yet promulgated support
levels for the implementation of the subsequent-period public-utility
telecommunications service program, beneficiaries who are receiving support in
the final month of the previous-period program and who continue to fall within
the eligible group for support for the use of universal telecommunications
services in the subsequent period shall continue to be applied the support
level for the use of universal telecommunications services corresponding to the
support level at the time the previous-period public-utility telecommunications
service program ends, until the competent state authority promulgates new
support levels;

telecommunications enterprises shall notify beneficiaries who are receiving
support in the final month of the previous-period program of their
responsibility as subscribers for paying service-use costs if they continue
using the enterprise’s services;

of assurance of continuity specified in Points a and b of this Clause, support
for the use of universal telecommunications services shall be implemented from
the time the new-period public-utility telecommunications service program takes
effect;

for service use after the end of the previous-period program, in the cases
specified in Points a and b of this Clause, shall be allocated from the
remaining funds of the previous-period program carried forward to the
subsequent period or from the budget of the subsequent-period program, and
settled against the budget of that subsequent-period program.

3. During the
implementation period of the public-utility telecommunications service program,
where at the end of a year the telecommunications enterprise has not yet
received from the local authorities the list of beneficiaries eligible for
support for the use of universal telecommunications services for the following
year, the enterprise shall notify the beneficiaries and shall suspend support
starting from the first month of the following year, except for the case
specified in Clause 4 of this Article.

Based on the guidelines
for implementing the public-utility telecommunications service program
promulgated by the Minister of Science and Technology of Vietnam, the
telecommunications enterprise shall remove beneficiaries from the list of those
supported for the use of universal telecommunications services when the
suspension period has expired without receiving the list of eligible
beneficiaries for the following year. The time of ending the suspension for
removal from the beneficiary list shall follow the guidelines for implementing
the public-utility telecommunications service program.

4. Where related
specialized laws stipulate that the time for announcing or completing the review
of beneficiaries eligible for support for the use of universal
telecommunications services is not in December of each year, the suspension
period shall begin from the month following the month of announcement or
completion of the review in accordance with regulations. The removal of
beneficiaries from the list of those supported for the use of universal
telecommunications services shall be carried out in accordance with the

**Section 3. PREPARATION
OF ESTIMATES, IMPLEMENTATION OF ESTIMATES, AND SETTLEMENT OF FUNDING FOR
PUBLIC-UTILITY TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACTIVITIES**

**Article 28. Grounds
for preparing funding estimates for supporting telecommunications enterprises
providing public-utility telecommunications services**

1. The expected volume of
public-utility telecommunications services to be provided through bidding,
order placement, or task assignment to telecommunications enterprises for
implementation in accordance with the public-utility telecommunications service
program, guidelines of the Minister of Science and Technology of Vietnam, and
the program implementation plan for each period.

Where the competent
authority has approved the implementation plan for the public-utility telecommunications
service program, the approved service volume shall apply.

Where the competent
authority has not approved the implementation plan, the service volume shall be
surveyed to prepare the plan, as well as estimates for support for enterprises
providing public-utility telecommunications services.

2. Requirements for
universalization of telecommunications services as provided in Article 5 of
this Decree and other relevant regulations.

3. The level of funding
for support for telecommunications enterprises providing public-utility
telecommunications services shall be based on one of the following information
sources or datasets:

a) Where estimates for
providing universal telecommunications services are prepared, and the competent
state authority has already promulgated cost norms for the provision of
universal telecommunications services under Clause 3, Article 19 of this Decree
for the ongoing public-utility telecommunications service program, the support
level shall be determined based on such cost norms and the costs specified in
Points c and d Clause 1 Article 19 of this Decree.

In this case, based on
surveys of the telecommunications infrastructure volume that needs to be
developed or upgraded by enterprises, the Vietnam public-utility telecommunications
service fund shall determine the service provision estimates for the entire
period, and select the proposal from the telecommunications enterprise offering
the lowest service provision cost. Expected revenue shall be estimated based on
surveyed data and proposals from at least 1 telecommunications enterprise
holding a dominant market position. It is encouraged to collect proposals from
more than 1 dominant telecommunications enterprise. In the case where multiple
enterprises provide proposals, the average expected revenue shall be used for
estimate preparation.

enterprise’s quotation represents the total funding proposed to be supported by
the State for providing public-utility telecommunications services to complete
the required service volume and meet the requirements for the universalization
of telecommunications services, the provision of mandatory telecommunications
services (if any), and other relevant regulations. The service volume attached
to the quotation shall be as proposed by the enterprise or as requested by the
entity soliciting the quotation.

The quotation must
specify the total amount of each cost under Clause 1, Article 19 of this
Decree, as well as the generated revenue, to determine the funding proposed for
support from the State under each method (bidding, order placement, and task
assignment). The funding estimate proposed for support from the State shall be
calculated according to the formula for calculating expenditures on support for
enterprises prescribed in Clause 2 Article 20, Clause 2 Article 21, and Clause
2 Article 22 of this Decree. Where service provision through bidding or task
assignment has more than 1 quotation, the lowest quotation (i.e., the one
proposing the lowest total amount of State support) shall be used in preparing
the estimate.

c) Results of contractor
selection for the provision of similar services within a maximum of 12 months
before the date the estimate is submitted for approval, which may be adjusted
to account for changes in planned service volume (if any). Similar services
