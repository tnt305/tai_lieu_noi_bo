More than ten-thousand Vietnames immigrants in the United States have taken to the streets of the Californian town of Westminster to demonstrate against a portrait of the late Vietnamese Communist leader Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese flag being displayed in a video store. The crowd sang patriotic songs and listened to a series of speakers calling for reform in Vietnam. The protests began last month when the owner of the store, Truong Van Tran, first put up the flag and poster saying he wanted to encourage fellow Vietnamese to view their homeland in a new way. A judge earlier barred the display but later reversed the decision.
