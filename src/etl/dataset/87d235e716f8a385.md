### Celebrating the 30th anniversary of the UNESCO Resolution honouring President Ho Chi Minh

#### Ha Noi, 24 November – The UNESCO Office in Hanoi joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism to commemorate the life and work of President Ho Chi Minh in a photo exhibit and international conference dedicated to celebrate the 30th Anniversary of UNESCO Resolution 24C/18.65.

The UNESCO Resolution enjoins Member States to recognize eminent intellectual and cultural personalities who have contributed to the realization of UNESCO objectives and to international understanding. Among these personalities, President Ho Chi Minh is honoured in the Resolution as “an outstanding symbol of national affirmation” who “devoted his whole life to the national liberation of the Vietnamese people, contributing to the common struggle of peoples for peace, national independence, democracy and social progress”.

Attended by Government officials, UN staff members, diplomats and embassy representatives based in Ha Noi, the 30th anniversary celebration showcased the revolutionary and cultural achievements of Ho Chi Minh, and organized an exchange of commemorative speeches from national and international delegates, to highlight Ho Chi Minh’s contribution to international peace and solidarity.

UNESCO Representative to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam Michael Croft expressed his personal reflections in the conference: “For me, Ho Chi Minh’s genius was not simply to understand and make preparations for the long struggle of national liberation before the struggle began, but that he could anticipate at the same time the considerations and requirements of a future peace, and incorporate these elements into his decision-making.”

Prior to this event, UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova also shared inspiring words about Ho Chi Minh in her speech during a cultural night in celebration of the Resolution organized by the Permanent Delegation of Viet Nam to UNESCO on 13 November 2017 in Paris, France.
