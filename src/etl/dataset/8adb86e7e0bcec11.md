**WESTMINSTER, Calif., Feb. 20— **
The Vietnamese immigrant who has battled his former countrymen here for weeks about his right to display a poster of Ho Chi Minh in his video store rehung the picture today, but it took dozens of police officers and sheriff's deputies to protect him and the First Amendment.

Dodging eggs, oranges and curses, the police hustled the merchant, Truong Van Tran, and his wife, Kim, into the store shortly before 10 A.M., as hundreds of protesters screamed ''Down with Communism'' and threatened to break through a thick line of officers.

The protesters surged forward at least three times, bending the line but not breaking it. By 10:15, the police had arrested about a dozen protesters, including a man who took a swing at the officers and a woman who rammed into the line with a stroller containing two children.

Inside the store, Mr. Tran, 37, climbed a metal ladder and fastened the poster and the flag of Vietnam to the wall with colored pins.

''I feel happy,'' Mr. Tran said after he and his wife bowed their heads in front of the display that has caused so much debate in this city south of Los Angeles where tens of thousands of Vietnamese, most of them refugees from South Vietnam, live in a neighborhood called Little Saigon.

But minutes later, Mr. Tran cried when he tried to explain that he loved his people here and in Vietnam and that he wanted to help chase away the ghosts of the Vietnam War that still haunt so many.

To begin the healing, Mr. Tran said, his fellow immigrants must learn to accept different views about their homeland without resorting to intimidation and violence. In the 1980's, people in Little Saigon were beaten and sometimes killed if they said anything remotely positive about normalizing relations with Vietnam. Stores that did business with Vietnam were burned.

''I am not afraid to do the right,'' Mr. Tran said. ''I want to communicate with the Vietnamese community. I want to help the Vietnamese community to live in peace.''

Vietnamese immigrants began arriving here in large numbers in 1975 after the fall of Saigon in the last days of the war. The memories of the bloodshed and their frightening flight from the Communists whom Ho Chi Min led until his death in 1969 are never far away.

Lieut. Bill Lewis of the Westminster Police Department said that during negotiations with Mr. Tran and the protesters over the last few days, some of the protesters threatened to set themselves on fire if Mr. Tran was allowed to hang the poster.

''They said they were going to do what the monks did in Vietnam in the mid-60's,'' Lieutenant Lewis said. ''That's the kind of emotion we've been dealing with.''

No one set himself on fire today, but numerous people screamed themselves hoarse.

''Who killed my father?'' a woman chanted.

''Ho Chi Minh,'' the crowded shouted back.

''Who killed my brother?''

''Ho Chi Minh.''

Indeed, many here lost a loved one during the war, which killed millions of Vietnamese from both north and south, including members of Mr. Tran's family.

''I am not a communist,'' said Mr. Tran, who fled southwest Vietnam and the communist regime for the United States in 1980. ''I do not think the communists do well in my country. They have to do more to change. But who helps them to change?''

The protests outside of the store, Hi-Tek, began last month after Mr. Tran put up the poster and the flag and then sent a fax to a Vietnamese group, daring it to take down the display. Mr. Tran said he was trying to engage the group in debate.

His former countrymen showed up by the hundreds to demand that the picture of ''Ho, the mass murderer'' be taken down. Mr. Tran refused. But after five days of increasingly tense protests, an Orange County Superior Court judge ordered the display removed pending a hearing. Last week, the judge said Mr. Tran had the First Amendment right to hang the items.

Hours after the ruling, more than 600 protesters gathered in front of the store, and were met by more than 100 police officers. Fearing violence, the authorities ordered Mr. Tran to stay away.

But at 4:30 A.M. today, the police returned to the store and caught the handful of protesters there off guard, pushing them behind a barricade.

The police could not get Mr. Tran into the shop as quickly as they had hoped. A locksmith had to be called in to break a chain that the protesters had used to lock Mr. Tran out.

By the time the door was opened and Mr. Tran was driven into the parking lot in a police van, the ranks of the protesters had grown to about 300, and more arrived throughout the morning. Mr. Tran said he was going to stay in his shop until noon, but the police whisked him away by 10:30.

Mr. Tran has been served with an eviction notice, but he has vowed to fight it, reopen his store and continue renting videos like the two on his display counter: ''Ghosts That Still Walk'' and ''Last Man Standing.''

The poster has outraged Mr. Tran's fellow immigrants from Vietnam, and he needed a police escort to reach his business to display it. (Monica Almeida/The New York Times)
